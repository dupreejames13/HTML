While a beekeeper is away, a thief enters his apiary and steals all the honey. When the bees return, they assume the beekeeper took all their honey and start to sting him. He calls them ungrateful because they let someone steal the honey and then attack the person who looks after them. The moral is, "Make sure you're seeking revenge on the right person."
